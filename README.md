# Particle-collider    

_**School project : February 2019**_

**_School project using C++ language and  QT creator._**  

This application is based on a simple main loop, computing position, speed and displacement vector of each particles generated during the init process.  
When a collision is found, the normal vector of the surface met is used to translate moving vector of each particles, also depending the weight of the particle (here, proportinonal to its diameter).

We also add constraints in order to simulate real conditions. For instance, air friction.
